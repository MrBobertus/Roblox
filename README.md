# Roblox Library Repository
Welcome to the Roblox Library! This is a collection of Roblox Assets like Scripts and Models that I’ve developed and published for use in various projects. Feel free to use these Assets in your own projects. However, there’s one simple condition: **credit must be given**. As a solo developer who’s just starting out, your support and acknowledgment mean a lot to me!

## What’s Inside?
This repository contains a variety of Roblox Assets like scripts, models and more.

## Language of scripts:
The scripts inside this repository are using the language LuaU which is a specific scripting language for Roblox but you may adapt the scripts to other languages if your are planning to use another coding language.
